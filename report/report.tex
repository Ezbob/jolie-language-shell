\section{Introduction}

When learning a new programming language, it is often useful to have a environment where the learner can execute code, quick and easy without having to worry about breaking the execution environment or installing new software locally. \\

\noindent{}The goal of this project was to create a cloud server for executing \jolie{} programs through the browser; and to embed the cloud server in a virtual environment provided by the virtualization library \docker{}.\\

\noindent{}To achieve this goal, we had to solve the following problems:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create an \docker{} image for running \jolie{} code in a \docker{} container. This image helps automating the process of creating new containers and is available on-line\footnote{https://hub.docker.com/r/ezbob/jolie/} for everyone interested in using \docker{} in conjunction with \jolie{}.
	\item Produce a service for handling the setup of the \docker{} container. As our execution environment uses \jolie{} to communicate between services, we opted to create a service that handles the communication with the \docker{} CLI.
	\item Make a service that can evaluate \jolie{} within the \docker{} container. For our evaluator to work, we have decided to use a \jolie{} service to evaluate sent \jolie{} code.
	\item Assemble a front-end service for presenting and handling of the user interface. Here we opted for a simple \jolie{}-based HTTP server that serves our user interface. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Technical Description}

\section{Related Work and Discussion}

Although we partly achieved what we set out to create; there are some limitation in the current implementation that can be expanded upon in future revision of this execution tool, namely the support for inter-service communications, better error explanation and dynamic linting\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint\_\%28software\%29} of the program code.
