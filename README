Installation of dependencies
------------

Warning: The interpreter relies on a Docker installation where the user is authorized as a sudo user.

1. Have Docker installed
    The installation guide for Docker can be found at: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
2. Add your user to the Docker group
    On most *nix systems this is done via the command:
	usermod -a -G docker <username>
    ! Beware this adds extra permissions to the user as the docker normally requires root permissions !
3. Have Jolie installed
    The installation guide is found here: http://www.jolie-lang.org/downloads.html
